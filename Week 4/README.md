# Azure Python Scripting Toolkit
## AZ-700 Prep - Week 4

> üìå This is Week 4 of a 6-week AZ-700 study and scripting project. For context and previous work, see [Week 1](https://github.com/logand99/AZ-700-Python-Labs/tree/a1abfbf74b02dae6407a4a39cf489f98a3533887/Week%201)

This project automates the creation and configuration of core Azure networking components using Python and the Azure SDKs. It supports multi-subscription and multi-region deployments defined via a single JSON configuration file.

## üîß Features added this week

- Create Public IPs for public load balancers from week 3
- Create Global and Regional Public Load Balancers
- Create internal load balancer
- Add VMs to backend pools, and create load balancing rules with health probes
- Supports public and internal load balancers with Standard SKU, regional or global IPs.

---

## üìÅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Azure CLI authenticated (or other credential methods supported by `DefaultAzureCredential`)
- Azure SDK libraries installed:

```bash
pip install azure-identity azure-mgmt-resource azure-mgmt-network azure-mgmt-privatedns
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

The script accepts a named JSON file using the --input_file argument:
```bash
python create_load_balancer.py --input_file inputs.json
```

## üìú Script Order (Initial Deployment)

You should run the scripts in order from Week 1, 2, and 3 folders. After the initial deployment, they can be safely rerun independently as needed.
Before running this script, be sure that a subnet for the load balancer has been defined and deployed using create_subnet.py from Week 1. This subnet is required for the load balancer to be created successfully.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that the VMs intended for the backend pool already exist in the target subnet before running the script. The script expects the VM names and NICs to be resolvable via the Azure SDK.

1. [**create_load_balancer.py**](https://github.com/logand99/AZ-700-Python-Labs/blob/2b961757e8afea0672e1c73b8ded4e6ff79245df/Week%204/create_load_balancer.py)  
   Deploys load balancers. Configured via `load_balancers` in the input JSON.

## üîÑ Rerunning Scripts

All scripts are idempotent where possible:

- Re-running will update existing resources.
- Connections and Gateways will reflect latest config from inputs.json.

## üìÇ Input File Format

All scripts read from a shared inputs.json. It must include:

- resource_groups: array of subscription, name, location
- vnets: each with name, address space, subnets, and peerings
- subnets: each may include an associated NSG, route table name, and security rules
- private_dns_zones: with registration-enabled VNet links
- public_ips: including names, skus, versions, etc.
- vpn_gateways: with all properties needed, and connections to local network gateways
- local_network_gateways: with on prem IP properties
- load_balancers: with backend pools, load balancing rules, and health probes
- See [inputs-example.json](https://github.com/logand99/AZ-700-Python-Labs/blob/2b961757e8afea0672e1c73b8ded4e6ff79245df/Week%204/inputs-example.json) in this repo for an example.

## ‚úÖ Output

Each script writes a result summary to output.json, including:

- Resource name
- Resource group
- Status (success / failed)
- Reason for any failures

## üìÑ Additional Files

   Instructions and script to deploy a lightweight NGINX server on backend VMs. This was used to validate traffic distribution for internal and global load balancer testing. Includes dynamic HTML content showing VM hostname, IP, and timestamp.
